<todo>
<item>
Make the routines that take a pointer return
just the return value unless the pointers are 
mutated.
</item>

<item>
Handle JSErrorReporter and function pointers generally.
<br/>
Basically, we will just leave these as untyped pointers
and define classes for each function pointer type
each of which extends/contains RNativeRoutineReference.
</item>

<item>
Put names on the inputs that are returned from callCIF.
This would allow .C() like access to the individual names.
And we should allow the caller to label the arguments.
</item>

<item status="low">
Create the struct objects if we need them to be non-opaque.
